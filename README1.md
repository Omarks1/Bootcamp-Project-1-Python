# BootCamp- First Project- 1: Library Management System

## 1- Idea:
In this system, the books and users are managed. Users can borrow, view all the books available in the library. The system should be able to handle multiple users and books.




## 2- Here is outlines of how the system could work:

- add_book: to add a book to the library( I needed help on the while loop)

- register_user: to add a new user
- borrow_book: for borrowing a book
(I neede help on if condition)
- view_books: for a user to view all books
- sorting_books: for sorting the books
(I needed help on sort function and how i integrated with the lambda function)
